# Falcon-SadTalker Integration

This project integrates the Falcon model for text generation, Bark for text-to-speech, and SadTalker for animation. The process is streamlined in a Jupyter Notebook (`4LD.ipynb`) to convert input text into animated speaking portraits. This is one of my university projects, nothing very hard, but for best performance, it was made to beb run in google colab.

## Repository Structure

```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/Falcon-SadTalker-Integration.git
   cd Falcon-SadTalker-Integration
   ```

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook 4LD.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

- Input your text in the provided cell in `4LD.ipynb`.
- The notebook will generate text using Falcon, convert it to speech with Bark, and animate it with SadTalker.
- The final output will be an audio file and an animated portrait.
